            <h1 id="letterTitle">Dear Babb,</h1>
            <p>
                Bab i hope this letter brings a smile to your face as much as the thought of you does to mine. I’ve been meaning to find the perfect words to express how I feel, but sometimes words just fall short of how special you truly are.
            </p>
            <p>
                From the moment I got to know you, something inside me felt different. Your kindness, your laughter, and the way you carry yourself—it all draws me in. I admire everything about you, and each time we talk or spend time together, I feel a warmth that I’ve come to treasure.
            </p>
            <p>
                I know this might seem sudden, but I wanted to be honest and let you know how much I care about you. I think you’re an amazing person, and I would love the chance to get to know you even better. If you ever feel the same, I’d be honored to be the one who makes you smile and be there for you in any way I can.
            </p>
            <p>
                But no matter what, bab, I want you to know that your happiness is what matters most to me. If that means we stay as we are, that’s perfectly okay with me. I’ll always be here, ready to listen, support, and share those special moments with you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you for being someone I can look up to and admire. You’re truly one of a kind, and I feel lucky just to know you. Mahal na mahal kita.
            </p>
